My interests center on developing novel approaches for early cancer detection and advancing payload technologies that enhance the precision, safety, and effectiveness of cancer treatments.</p> <p>I’m especially interested in research and translational efforts that connect mechanism-driven science with scalable solutions—whether through next-generation therapeutics, improved diagnostics, or platforms that make treatment more personalized.</p> </body></html>
